# EasyMerge

EasyMerge is a simple yet powerful web app designed to merge the front and back pages of scanned documents into a single PDF file. Perfect for those who have a scanner that doesn't support duplex scanning.

## How It Works

1. **Upload the Front Side PDF**: Drag and drop or select your PDF file containing the front sides of your document pages.

2. **Upload the Back Side PDF**: Drag and drop or select your PDF file containing the back sides of your document pages. Please ensure that the back sides are in reverse order, as they would be when flipping through a book.

3. **Merge and Download**: After both files are uploaded, click the "Merge" button. The app will combine the front and back pages into a single PDF, which you can then download.
